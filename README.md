SMASHERS
Screenplay Outline

ACT 1 — SETUP — The Protagonist is an Orphan

### Scene 1
Escalating back and forth between the town's Friday Night Derby and the murder of the town's MAYOR. CODY wins the Derby (as is his custom) and the mayor is run off the road.

### Scene 2
Cody picks up a sweet OLD LADY on his way to work. She's just picked up a bag of groceries, which get spilled all over his car, as he drives like a bat out of hell, showing off his skills. The whole time, he's telling her what a great driver he is — and he tells her the big news... That the national circuit is sending a scout to one of the upcoming races.

### Scene 3
Cody is confronted at work by his coworker / best friend, STU. The confrontation is about a car that Cody essentially stole from an innocent customer. That customer happened to be at last night's Derby and saw her "un-driveable" car being smashed to smithereens by Cody. Later in the day, Cody learns that the mayor is dead. The first thought to cross his mind is getting his hands on the mayor's car, a classic Imperial (Imperial's are the best cars for the derby, and they're harder and harder to come by).

### Scene 4
Cody and Stu tow the mayor's car back to the shop. They notice suspicious tire tracks while on the scene. On the way back, they talk about Cody's relationship with TAMMY — Cody thinks things have never been better, but Stu looks highly suspicious. He knows better.

### Scene 5
Cody convinces Stu to spend all his spare time fixing up the mayor's Imperial. He wants to drive it in the big race so he can qualify for the nationals. After several hours, Stu discovers a secret compartment in the Imperial that contains some mysterious documents.

**This is Plot Point 1.**
The hidden documents appear to reveal 1) that the mayor was a gambling addict, 2) that he embezzled a lot of the city's money, 3) that the city is on the verge of bankruptcy, and 4) that the mayor was being pressured to sell the city's land to some billionaire land developers in order to pay his personal debts.


## ACT 2a — CONFLICT — The Protagonist is a Wanderer

### Scene 1
Stu and Cody look over the papers and start to piece together the gravity of the situation. It becomes evident that Cody will have to do something to save the town... Not only is he the town's most influential citizen, he also has the mayor's car. Cody reluctantly accepts the responsibility, with one caveat: it can't get in the way of his ambitions to become a nationally-known Smasher.

### Scene 2
Cody has a drink at the local watering hole, which is mostly empty. He sits a few seats away from a crusty old man named RAY. Cody thinks he recognizes Ray, but he can't place the face. They shoot the breeze, talking about the town, the Derby, and the mayor's death. The Mentor criticizes Cody's driving in the Derby, revealing that his character has a background as a driver. All Cody really knows is that Ray isn't happy being in the town (he's a visitor who's passing through). The two walk out of the bar together, and Cody sees Ray run into several cars as he speeds out of the parking lot. 

*Note: The make and model of the mentor's car is distinct and prominent.*

### Scene 3
Cody drives home in the Mayor's car. We hear Bad Company's "Feel Like Makin' Love" blasting on the radio. Cody loudly walks into the house, shouting to Tammy that he wants to jump her bones in the back of the Imperial. He's unaware that he's very awkwardly crashing his girlfriend's most important Mary Kay party (she's very close to earning her pink Cadillac). But thanks to Cody, all of her work was for nothing... Her friends all leave because it's so awkward. She doesn't sell a single thing.

### Scene 4
Cody and Tammy fight. We learn that Tammy has been disappointed time and time again by Cody. Not least of all, she's wanting to see some commitment (read: a wedding ring). Instead, she spends all of her energy supporting Cody and his crazy Derby dreams. In fact, she's racked up quite a bit of credit card debt to support Cody's freewheeling lifestyle. She's disappointed now, because she'd told Cody multiple times that tonight was her big Mary Kay party. He was supposed to be there early to cook burgers. Instead, he shows up three hours late, drunk, and horny.

### Scene 5
Cody is beating it in the back of the Imperial with a car magazine, covering up the model's picture and focusing on the vehicles. He's using a small trial size bottle of lotion, that he swiped from Tammy's party. This is potentially the moment, when all of the town's women walk out of the house to leave the party.

*Note: If possible, have the old lady's groceries scattered in the back of the car.*

### Scene 6
A gaggle of TOWNSWOMEN are seen getting their hair done in Tammy's salon. The room goes silent the moment Tammy walks in; she knows they're talking about her. She confronts them, but they end up telling her that it's time to leave Cody in the rearview. To round out the intervention, they tell her they are going to help make her the most successful Mary Kay salesperson in the state.

### Scene 7
Cody and Stu are working at the shop, when a news report comes on about an unidentified reckless driver who's wreaking havoc on the town's roads. The mayor's death is mentioned, and the reporter questions potential connections. For the first time, they have a vague description of a suspicious car. Cody instantly knows it's the old guy from the bar. He decides he has to investigate the situation. After all, he told Stu he'd help solve the Mayor's murder.

### Scene 8
Cody investigates the car at City Hall, tracking it back to Ray. Now that he knows the guy's name, he knows why he looked so familiar. He's a legendary driver who left the town behind to go pro.

### Scene 9
The ladies from the salon host a bigger and better Mary Kay Party for Tammy. Everyone woman and girl from the town shows up and they sell enough to earn Tammy her Mary Kay Cadillac.

### Scene 10
Cody tracks down Ray at the bar and confronts him. Things go south, and they end up in a head-to-head car chase as Ray tries to flee. The result is that Cody and the Imperial get run off the road and he hurts his neck. After the wreck, Ray gets out of his car to critique Cody's driving, revealing that he's got a history with the Derby. "You drive like that next week, you ain't going to the Big Leagues!" Cody asks, "You're the scout?" As the conversation continues, we also learn that the Mentor has an alibi for the night of the murder (he was at the town titty-bar with some business associates).

### Scene 11
Cody comes home late (wearing a neck brace), as the last guests are leaving the party. Cody attempts awkwardly to repair the damaged relationship. Tammy is overlooking things at the moment (even her friends' advice to end it with Cody that very night) because she's so excited that she just earned the pink Cadillac. We're also reminded that Cody now needs a car to qualify in the Derby since the Imperial was wrecked again. He talks about his dream of finally making it and what their life will be like together once he finally goes pro. Their lives are about to change... 

### Scene 12
The next day at work, Stu asks Cody what happened to the Imperial. Cody explains. Stu's assessment is that the car isn't fixable in the short amount of time before the qualifying derby. Cody is back to scheming to get a car from an unsuspecting customer at the garage. Stu confronts the situation and Cody explains how desperate he is to get a car (reiterating his dream to leave the town and to go pro). They start talking about the investigation, and since they're at a dead end, Stu says he wants to take the paperwork to someone on the City Council — probably RICK. After all, Stu reasons, Rick is the town Treasurer and he runs successful businesses in the big city down the road. Cody protests, citing his deep-seeded hatred of Rick.

### Scene 13
Cody and Stu go to meet Rick in the city, where Rick works as the Manager of the cell phone accessories kiosk in the mall. Stu is interested in investigating the mayor's death, but Cody is obsessed with finding a car. Stu shows Rick a ledger showing a bunch of payments which don't show up in the city's official budget. Through the conversation, we learn about Rick's character and history. Rick assures Stu that he'll take care of all further investigation, using the power of his office on the City Council to get to the truth. Cody takes over the conversation and starts talking smack about the race.

**Evidence**
The ledger book Stu found details what appears to be a series of under-the-table transactions coming out of the city's budget. Stu suspects that the mayor was embezzling funds. In reality, Rick, who is the Treasurer on the City Council, is the one embezzling money (to fund his various failed ventures). The mayor had actually caught on, and was investigating Rick at the time of his death, when he was killed by Rick's cousin, DALE. Rick confides in Stu the fact that the mayor had a gambling problem, which is why he likely was embezzling funds.

### Scene 14
The entire town is abuzz and present for a much anticipated City Council meeting, where the primary order of business is appointing an interim mayor until a proper election can be scheduled. The meeting goes as follows:

* First Order of Business — Appointing Rick as interim mayor
* Q&A from the town
* Rick's comments on the investigation into the mayor's death —  new evidence has surfaced, Rick's office will be working with the police.
* Rick disparages the mayor posthumously, implying that he had a gambling problem and had brought the city to the brink financially, probably embezzling funds.
* Through all of this, Rick tries to look like a leader: "Frankly, I'm not worried how or why the mayor died — heck, he probably killed himself, and he deserved it. But we have to move on and deal with the mess he's left us with."
* Rick points out that the city's financial situation is dire because of his predecessor's irresponsibility
* But Rick has a plan... He introduces the idea of bringing in a group of successful real estate developers who are interested in helping the town out financially. He takes a vote about whether or not to consider the option of bringing in the developers.
* At some point in the meeting, Rick takes a call on his Bluetooth earpiece.
* Cody asks for a point-of-order, and uses it to ask about borrowing a car to use in tomorrow night's qualifier. This doesn't go over well — the lady whose car he recently smashed cusses him out. Cody is more determined than ever to go pro so he can get out of this shit-hole town.

### Scene 15
The morning of the big race (and the morning after the City Council meeting), Stu is now highly suspicious of the  developers. Rick told him after the meeting that the developers had been wanting to do this deal with the town for years, but had been thus prevented by the mayor, who recently died. This doesn't make sense to Stu... If the mayor was really in financial trouble, why wouldn't he have taken a deal with these developers? He thinks the developers might have killed the mayor to take over the town. Cody could care less about Stu's speculation. He's got less than 12 hours to find a car. So he hatches a plan that he deems to be high-risk, high-reward. But the plan is going to require him calling in a favor from Stu, who resists initially. But Cody twists his arm, reminding Stu that he used to protect him from bullies way back in high school...

### Scene 16
The big qualifying race is one of the biggest things to have ever happened to the town, and everyone is there. The winner will get a pro contract and a chance to compete in the upcoming national championship.

* The cars / drivers are introduced one at a time, culminating with Cody and his pink Cadillac of fury: Mary Kay-os.
* The announcer reminds everyone of the stakes, and introduces the hometown hero, Ray, who is back in town (reluctantly) scouting for the pro league. He's up in the booth with the developers, which creates an interesting contrast between the town's past and future. Perhaps the developers want to recruit Ray as a spokesperson. Most importantly, Ray wants to know what the developers see in the shitty town. The developers explain that their interest is in the town's mud, which has remarkable rejuvenating properties. They want to build a spa and sell branded products internationally.
* The race has been underwritten by the developers, who run a slick ad before the competition. 
* The derby comes down to two finalists, Cody and Dale.
* Cody wins and is elated.
* Tammy's boss is at the race and she calls Tammy (who is at the salon doing the old lady's hair). She tells Tammy that her deadbeat boyfriend is destroying her hard-won Mary Kay Cadillac.
* Tammy shows up with Old Lady in tow and goes ape on Cody, telling him that their relationship is over. Tammy is finally taking the townswomen's advice and leaving Cody's sorry ass.

## MIDPOINT / ACT 2b — CONFLICT — The Protagonist is a Warrior

### Scene 1
Mary Kay-os is demolished, but Cody is victorious. He's one step closer to his big dream. Tammy shows up at the track with the old lady in tow (her hair is half-done). Tammy goes ape on Cody and ends the relationship in a very public way. Still caught up in the throes of victory, Cody doesn't realize the gravity of the situation. He brushes it off, and goes out drinking with the townspeople to celebrate his awesomeness.

### Scene 2
Cody wakes up the next morning in Mary Kay-os, which is parked outside the watering hole. He's surrounded by beer cans and various and sundry remnants of revelry. Cody decides he'll go home to patch things up with Tammy. He thinks she was just a little worked up about the situation and assumes that everything will be alright once he fixes things. After all, he’s grounded in the firm belief that she'll overlook it all because he’s soon to be a national champion.

### Scene 3
The developers are going from house to house, giving personalized presentations to the townspeople. We see a microcosm of the developers' plan in action (what started with an exploratory vote and a slick ad at the Derby is now an aggressive ground game). The developers are accompanied by Rick, who translates the complicated terms into simpler dialogue for the townspeople. When Cody rolls up at Tammy's house in what's left of Mary Kayos, Rick and the developers are in the middle of a presentation to Tammy. Tammy is trying to be polite, but she's heartbroken and is in a rush to hit the road before Cody returns.

### Scene 4
Cody walks into the scene and realizes Tammy is about to leave. The shit hits the fan. Somehow in the conversation, we learn that Cody isn’t even on the mortgage — it's Tammy's house and what she does with it is her decision. Tammy explains that she is going to have her sister pick her up and that she's leaving town because she needs some time and space to think. Overhearing this, Rick says that isn't necessary — he’s traveling to the city and wouldn’t mind giving her a ride. There is a huge confrontation between Rick and Cody. In the end, Rick gives Tammy a ride, and Cody is left in the empty house by himself. It's in this moment that Cody resolves that he will have to both win the race and fix Mary Kay-os in order to win Tammy back. 

*Note: The love triangle between Cody, Tammy, and Rick dates back to high school. Perhaps she says something about how her parents were right, that she should've chosen Rick rather than dating a Smasher.*

### Scene 5
Back at the shop, Cody is amped up to tell Stu about his idea to win Tammy back. Stu explains that there are bigger concerns. He has become deeply suspicious of the developers after observing them at the Big Race. He wants to meet with the Mayor’s widow to investigate potential connections between the developers and the mayor's death. Stu uses a memento he found in the car as an excuse to talk to the widow. Cody wants to tag along because he needs to spill his guts about the Tammy situation (or at least, that's what he ends up doing).

### Scene 6
The mayor’s wife unknowingly reveals some information about the developers and how the mayor has been fighting them for years while at the same time trying to keep the town solvent. It is here we possibly have a scene where the mayor’s wife gives Cody some information about what makes relationships work, possibly shedding a new light for Cody. We learn that the mayor and his wife are not shady, but rather exemplary people. Everything Rick said publicly about the mayor was not true. Both Cody and Stu are convinced that the developers killed the mayor because they want to take over the town.

### Scene 7
Even though Cody is fixated on the national derby, he wants to help Stu save the town from the developers. After all, he needs to do something to take his mind off of Tammy. Cody and Stu have a conversation about how they have to rally the town to resist the developers. During the day, they work at the shop, but at night they work on the investigation and rally support. Cody becomes a grassroots organizer with Stu, trying to stop the developers from taking over the town. 

### Scene 8
The developers face increasing resistance from the townspeople because of Cody and Stu's campaign. They had been making slow progress, but now they realize that Cody and Stu pose a real threat (previously they had written them off as a joke). After all, Cody's influence with the townsfolk is at an all-time high after his big win. At the same time, Rick and Tammy’s relationship is starting to grow; Rick uses a vulnerable pillow talk moment to broach the subject of selling her house. This takes place in an incredibly funny sex scene where Rick is talking on the Bluetooth earpiece and Tammy mistakenly takes it for dirty talk (double entendres). In reality, it's the developers calling Rick to tell him to get Tammy to sell in order to crush Cody. She thinks it's hanky-panky. Rick realizes the ideal plan is to buy Tammy’s house by offering her a valuation that she couldn’t possibly refuse. She thinks Rick is an incredibly talented businessman for getting her the deal, completely oblivious to what's really going on.

*Note: Selling the house would crush Cody emotionally and it takes advantage of the earlier weakness that was revealed when Cody was making a scene with Tammy.*

### Scene 9
Tammy puts her house on the market and Cody is forced to move out immediately. Cody stands out front crying as the bulldozers move in. Cody moves in with Stu. He’s riled up because he knows that Rick convinced Tammy to sell. He starts to become more of the warrior and takes on a greater mission to save the town. Cody and Stu redouble their efforts to stop the developers. It culminates in an informal but well-attended town meeting at a bar. Riding atop newfound glory and rage, Cody takes it upon himself to rally the people and shows his ability to lead. He gets everyone to agree not to sell and to face the developers with staunch resistance. This is a false win; the town believes they've forced the developers out. In reality, the developers are happy to lull the town into complacency while they implement a more sinister plan using legal options.

*Note: When Cody is selling the townspeople on the plan, he uses the same skills he used to cheat that lady out of her car.*

### Scene 10
While leaving the rally at the watering hole, Ray swerves to avoid our favorite old lady, who is crossing the street. Instead, Ray smashes into an attorney who's walking down the sidewalk with a briefcase. It's a hit-and-run, papers fly everywhere from the victim's briefcase. The old lady moves in to the scene, initially to help, but then gets distracted by the content of the confidential papers: "Oh, dear!"

**Evidence:**
The papers show that the developers are working with Rick as the new mayor to take over the entire town via eminent domain. This is all possible because of the fact that the town is insolvent (due to Rick's years of embezzlement while Treasurer).*

### Scene 11
The next morning, Cody (who feels he's saved the town) has turned his attention to winning Tammy back. To do that, he believes he has to fix Mary Kay-os. Riding his leadership high, he now sees himself as a real authority, and he starts bossing Stu around without appreciating his essential contributions. Stu has been working around the clock to get the Imperial ready for the championship derby (when he hasn't been working on the investigation). Cody waltzes in to work three hours late. He starts delegating even more work to Stu, tasking him with fixing Mary Kay-os. The false win has inflated Cody’s ego. A conflict ensues between Stu and Cody. It is this overzealousness, arrogance, and incompetence (coupled with Stu's fatigue and good-natured temperament) that leads to a fatal situation. Cody doesn't secure Mary Kay-os properly on the lift, and he drops the car on Stu, crushing him to death: “Oh, shit!" Cut to black.

### Scene 12
Hard cut to Stu's wake. Cody is in a very bad place. He sits alone in the back of the funeral home, guilty and distraught. We hear whispers about it being a closed casket service because Stu was so mangled. All the townspeople show up and we hear more whisperings. Something is afoot. The old lady shows up and is talking to a small group of townsfolk gathered in the corner (it includes fellow derby drivers and the mayor's widow). The small group stays long after everyone but Cody has left. Finally, the group approaches Cody. They apologize for having to broach the subject, but then reveal the eminent domain plot that was revealed by the hit and run. No one wants to bring it up to Cody because they realize he is very emotional. All is lost. Cody has lost his best friend, doesn’t have a car for the derby, lost his girlfriend to Rick (who showed up to the wake with Tammy), and is now incapable of saving the town.

### Scene 13
After Cody is left by himself with Stu's mangled body and the eminent domain document he goes to the bathroom. He is about to lose it, and starts talking to himself in the bathroom mirror. It's the first time he's confronted himself and realized what a total piece of shit he is. He starts talking to Stu, asking him what to do. That's when he gets a crazy idea...

### Scene 14
We see Cody sneaking around the funeral home after hours, observing an attendant loading Stu's casket into a hearse.

### Scene 15
We see the hearse crash through the funeral home garage door at a high rate of speed, shattering the silence of the night with the screech of tires. Cody is behind the wheel and he has a plan...

### Scene 16
We see Cody driving through the night to the big derby event in Charlotte, windows open, and appropriate music blaring in the background. Perhaps he's talking to Stu. He's going to make everything right. As he leaves the town he always vowed he would leave, he realizes that this isn't what he wanted. He is committed to the town after all. He's about to become the martyr...


## ACT 3 — RESOLUTION — The Protagonist is a Martyr

### Scene 1
Cody gets to Charlotte with just enough time left to stop by the hardware store for a can of spray paint, which he uses to put war paint on the hearse. He cries as he applies the spray paint, but then his face goes steely. The moment he's been waiting for his entire life has arrived.

### Scene 2
The drivers are announced, featuring an all-star cameo cast as the best derby drivers from around the nation. An even bigger surprise than the hearse is that Dale has been announced as the final driver. The developers pulled some strings and got him into the race. Cody isn't the only one from his town.

### Scene 3
Drivers are eliminated one by one, until it's just Cody and Dale going head to head. Throughout the derby, Rick is on the phone with Dale, serving as his eye in the sky and calling the shots. He keeps getting incoming calls on his Bluetooth earpiece, which he manages using call waiting. At one point, he is talking to his cousin, the developers, and Tammy, all at once. Before long, he's switching so much that he makes a mistake, and says something to Tammy that he meant to say to Dale, "Finish him like you did the mayor! Use the Carolina Pussy-Sweeper." This instantly tells Tammy what she was beginning to be afraid of — that Rick had something to do with the mayor's death.

**Note: Have earlier scene where Rick is carrying the ledger and Tammy asks him what it's about.**

### Scene 4
Dale uses the unusual Carolina Pussy-Sweeper move, which is instantly recognized by both Cody and Tammy. Tammy realizes it's the aggressive move that Rick described on the phone. But Cody recognizes the distinct tire tracks it left behind — they match the tire tracks at the scene of the mayor's death! Because Cody's such a good driver, he manages to maneuver out of danger with a 360-degree evasive maneuver. In the process, Stu's casket is propelled out of the back of the hearse. It flies across the arena and lodges directly in Dale's windshield, killing him instantly. Cody says, "What goes around, comes around. Right, Stu?"

### Scene 5
While the two corpses are being cleared from the background, Cody is awarded the championship on national television (ESPN 4). He should be thrilled, but he's distracted. He now knows that Rick's cousin, Dale, was the mayor's killer. Tammy knows it too, and she seeks Cody out behind the podium. She tells Cody that she thinks that Rick was behind it all — that he told Dale to do the signature move. She also knows where to get evidence that proves Rick had a motive...

### Scene 6
Cody and Tammy break into Rick's Mazda Miata. In the glovebox, they find the ledger that was originally recovered from the mayor's Imperial. As they find it, Tammy begins to explain what it all means when, all of a sudden, Rick plows into his own Miata driving the ambulance he hijacked from the arena (perhaps his cousin is still in the back). Cody manages to hot-wire the Miata, and an epic chase ensues.

### Scene 7
An epic chase ensues, during which Cody and Tammy cover a gamut of topics, including: their broken relationship, Stu's death, Cody's championship win, the town's situation, and the evidence that they now hold implicating Rick. The scene concludes with Rick driving them to the edge of some precipice. But Cody uses the Carolina Pussy-Sweeper that he just learned to move out of the way at the last second, letting the ambulance plunge over the cliff.

### Scene 8
Cut to the aftermath, with cops on the scene. Rick's guilt is explained to the officers on the scene (and thus, to the audience). The police want to take statements, but Rick and Tammy want to make up and smash each other's brains out, awkwardly. In front of the authorities.

### Scene 9
One year later... Cody, now the mayor, visits Rick in jail. On one hand, this is the most satisfying moment Cody could ever imagine, the kind of triumph he's longed for since high school. But he's also grown through the ordeal and, in a way, feels bad for Rick. Rick, has only become embittered. He's in jail in an electric wheelchair. Cody comes to let him know how the town is doing one year later — they fixed their financial crisis without killing anybody. But more importantly, Cody wanted to bring Rick a memento — a miniature personalized vanity plate for his wheelchair (it matches the one he had on the Miata). This scene is about poetic justice.

*Note: Maybe when Rick gets to the wall of glass, he instinctively tries to push his Bluetooth earpiece, which he doesn't have anymore, rather than using the prison phone.*

### Scene 10
Having seen his nemesis in prison, Cody drives up to the first annual MegaMud Festival (in the mayor's old Imperial, which is fully restored). The town is now the site of the national league championships — they secured a 10-year contract. The whole ordeal brought national attention to the town, along with tourists and their money. It also fixed the long-term financial concerns of the residents. We see the result of Cody's first year as mayor as we wrap up the story:

* We see that the town looks nicer and happier. The people are better dressed.
* Cody isn't smashing things.
* The mayor's wife is so happy to see the Imperial back and running again.
* The Stadium has been named after Stu.
* Tammy, who is very pregnant, is running a business that sells the town's mud as a beauty treatment, and it's about to be picked up by Mary Kay for national distribution. This creates jobs and gives the city the financial benefit the developers had promised, but without having them involved.
* The salon ladies all work for Tammy in the Mud business.
* Ray, the Mentor, came back to the town, following Cody's example. And he is dating the old lady (this mirrors her introduction, her new boyfriend drives like a bat out of hell).
* Cody has an office at City Hall.
* Cody used part of the winnings to buy a new car for the lady whose car he originally smashed.
* The developers got outsmarted by some hillbillies (we see them watching the event on TV on ESPN, from in NYC). They lose their jobs.
* Tammy is shown loading palettes of the mud product into the back of Mary Kay-Os, who has been fixed up, but is keeping the new name. When she closed the trunk, maybe we see JUST MARRIED on the rear windshield.

### Scene 11
Credits rolling. Cody and Tammy take their baby son Stu to the graveyard to visit the person he's named after. As they leave, Cody accidentally backs over the gravestone, "Well, shit!"

# The End.
